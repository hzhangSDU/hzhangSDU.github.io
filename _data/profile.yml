    I'm an interdisciplinary researcher interested in applying advanced artificial intelligence methods to hydrogen safety, 
    understand the spatio-temporal evolution law of high-pressure hydrogen leakage diffusion, 
    and optimize the deployment of multi-source heterogeneous hydrogen sensors by using RL and computational fluid dynamics techniques.

  <p>
    I am currently a <strong>Ph.D. student</strong> in 
    <a href="http://www.control.sdu.edu.cn/info/1126/6521.htm" target="_blank">National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Optimal Control of New Energy and High-Efficiency Energy-Saving Systems</a>
     at <a href="https://www.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm" target="_blank">Shandong University</a>, 
    advised by Prof. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086126603" target="_blank">Bo Sun (IEEE Member)</a> in the 
    Hydrogen Energy Optimization Control Lab. 
    I previously earned my B.S. degree in Internet of Things Engineering from <a href="https://www.sdjzu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shandong Jianzhu University</a>, 
    working in the Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Smart Building and Building Energy Efficiency with Prof. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37577297400" target="_blank">Chengdong Li (IEEE Member)</a> 
    and Prof. Wei Peng. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I have authored or co-authored more than 10 international journal and conference papers, 
    particularly in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9424" target="_blank">IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</a> and
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031597" target="_blank">IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</a>.
    And, I have been the Reviewer for several international conferences and journals, such as 
    <a href="https://xplorestaging.ieee.org/xpl/aboutJournal.jsp?punumber=91" target="_blank">IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems</a>,
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=28" target="_blank">IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications</a>, 
    and 
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11227" target="_blank">The Journal of Supercomputing</a> (hosted by Springer Nature).

    Now, as a key member, I have participated in three National Key R&D Program Projects of China (funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, with an amount exceeding 800 million CNY), 
    and have also participated in the formulation of a local standard of Shandong Province (

    <span style="color: #d60000;">I am looking for collaborators and interns</span> 
    interested in AI, and its applications in hydrogen safety and optimal design of energy systems.
    My goal is to develop novel tools, algorithms, and methodologies to reduce the risks of leakage and explosion during the application of hydrogen energy.
